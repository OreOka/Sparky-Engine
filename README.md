# Sparky-Engine
Based on the Sparky Engine series done by TheCherno. Link to the playlist here. I added my modifications as needed

The main.cpp is just a feature test page. 
This is a visual studio solution. 
The file and properties and profiles are all stored in visual studio's format.
# Work is done in C++ not C
Most of the code appears to be in C. This is because of the Freetype files included for the emscripten to be able to work with and convert to javascript. However all my coding was done in c++.
